# odin-recipes
This is my first project on html! it's a simple recipe project !
This small project will provide anyone who sees it with 3 easy to make recipes. I had fun making it since I was actually in need of finding recipes.
I'm still lacking in many ways and I hope this is just the beginning and I would eventually improve.
In this project, I made 3 recipes out of pure html. 
I used headings to separe different parts of the recipe.
first part is the name of the recipe, a picture of the recipe, and a small description. I admit that I wasn't creative on the description.
second part is the ingredients on which I used an unordered list. 
and the last part is an ordered list where I listed all the steps you need to take to prepare that recipe.
Cheers!
