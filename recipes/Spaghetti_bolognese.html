        <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>2 garlic gloves</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>500g of beef mince</li>
            <li>2 beef bouillon cubes</li>
            <li>125ml of dry red wine</li>
            <li>800g of can crushed tomato</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon of tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon of white sugar</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
            <li>2 sprigs of fresh thyme</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>400g of spaghetti</li>
            <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium high heat. Add onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and softened.</li>
            <li>Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go, until browned.</li>
            <li>Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.</li>
            <li>Add remaining ingredients except salt and pepper. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes (no lid), adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste. Stir occasionally.</li>
            <li><strong>Slow simmer option:</strong> really takes this to another level, if you have the time! Add 3/4 cup of water, cover with lid and simmer on very low for 2 – 2.5 hours, stirring every 30 minutes or so. (Note 5) Uncover, simmer 20 minutes to thicken sauce. (Note 6 for slow cooker)</li>
            <li>Adjust salt and pepper to taste right at the end. Serve over spaghetti – though if you have the time, I recommend tossing the sauce and pasta per steps below.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to boil. Add pasta and cook per packet directions MINUS 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Scoop out a mug of pasta cooking water and set aside, then drain the pasta.</li>
            <li>Add pasta into the bolognese sauce with about 1/2 cup (125 ml) of reserved pasta water over medium heat. Toss gently for 1 1/2 – 2 minutes, or until the spaghetti turns red and the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Divide between bowls. Garnish with parmesan and parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
